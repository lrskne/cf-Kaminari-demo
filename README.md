Points 10
Submitting a website url
Objective: Add Kaminari for Pagination deploy an app to Heroku.

1) Build a CRUD app for any any resource you want. You may use a scaffold, but if you do remove all of the JSON related content code and files (Look in the controller and in the views directory.) We don't want to support JSON in this application. You can also build your own.
2) Route the root (homepage) to the resource index page.
3) Add a link to your github repository on the root page of your application.
4) Add Kaminari to the gemfile. Bundle.
5) Add pagination to the resource index. We want to paginate every 4 records. (Dumb I know.)
6) Create an account on Heroku. Install Heroku Toolbelt. Sign in.
7) Modify your application to deploy to Heroku, if need be.
8) Create an app on heroku and deploy it.

Submit the link to your site on Heroku for credit. Also include:
Difficulty out of 1-10. (10 being impossible.)
